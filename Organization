SINGLE PLAYER:
Classes:
    *Tetromino
        shape
        location on grid - maybe an array of the 4 blocks it takes up? int[][] of int[] with row and column?
    *Grid/Matrix? (i think this should be 2 separate classes, one handles all the movement and stuff, the other handles the graphics)
        2D array 
        current tetrimino
        held piece 
        boolean usedHeld (if already swapped held piece, can't swap again)
        array for next pieces
        method for drawing a square on a block -> method for drawing a tetrimino on a certain position
        timer
        key listener for arrow keys, space, rotation, hold?
            left or right
                if not already leftmost or rightmost column, change location variable and redraw
            space
                get bottom-most free column, change location variable, redraw
                get new tetrimino
            rotate
                big yikes.
                axes of rotation: http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/SRS?file=SRS-pieces.png
                http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/SRS will do
            hold
                if no held piece, add current piece to held and get new piece
                if haven't already swapped, swap current tetrimino with held piece
        method for checking if line cleared
            for each row on grid check if all blocks are full
            if full, delete row and shift everything down a row (play an animation???? i think it's possible)
            get new tetrimino from next pieces
    *Menu/main class
        will have the main method
        will do a thing
Enums:
  TetriminoShape
  GridStatus (empty, piece, sent line, etc. helps us handle graphics a bit more easily)
  TetrisGameState (menu, ingame, paused)
  TetrisGameType (self-explanatory)
