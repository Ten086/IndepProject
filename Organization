SINGLE PLAYER:
Classes:
    *Tetromino
        shape
        location on grid - maybe an array of the 4 blocks it takes up? int[][] of int[] with row and column?
        rotate method for different shapes here, then use this in Grid/Matrix?
        
    *Grid/Matrix? (i think this should be 2 separate classes, one handles all the movement and stuff, the other handles the graphics)
        2D array 
        current tetromino
        held piece 
        boolean usedHeld (if already swapped held piece, can't swap again)
        array for next pieces
        method for drawing a square on a block -> method for drawing a tetrimino on a certain position
        timer
        key listener for arrow keys, space, rotation, hold?
            left or right
                if not already leftmost or rightmost column, change location variable and redraw
            space
                get bottom-most free column, change location variable, redraw
                get new tetrimino
            rotate
                big yikes.
                axes of rotation: http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/SRS?file=SRS-pieces.png
                http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/SRS will do
            hold
                if no held piece, add current piece to held and get new piece
                if haven't already swapped, swap current tetrimino with held piece
        method for checking if line cleared
            for each row on grid check if all blocks are full
            if full, delete row and shift everything down a row (play an animation???? i think it's possible)
            get new tetromino from next pieces
    *Menu
        select single player or multiplayer
        if single player, difficulty?
        if multiplayer, first racing or versus, second same keyboard or maybe dif keyboards?
            i don't think multiple keyboards is a good idea
            Yeah that's fine we can do same keyboard and then maybe see if we could use 
            that library for different keyboards if we have time
        Key Listener <- Mouse Listener?
Enums:
  TetrominoShape
  GridStatus (empty, piece, sent line, etc. helps us handle graphics a bit more easily)
      do we want to do the fb sent line style with bombs? or arena
      I'm good with either, I don't remember how bombs work tho
      bombs just work like the entire garbage line clears if you place a piece on the bomb
      v fun for combos
      Oh ok maybe do bombs then?
  Point
  TetrisGameState (menu, ingame, paused)
  TetrisGameType (self-explanatory)
