# IndepProject

Prototype:
Since we are planning to make the game Tetris for our main project, our proposal will involve a grid 
with randomly generated falling pieces that the player can move left and right. The prototype will 
not include rotation, dropping pieces, or clearing lines, which will be added in the main project. 

Main project:
Our main project is the game Tetris. The user will be able to move, rotate, and drop their pieces 
using keyboard input. The project will use graphical input/output. The main project is different from 
the prototype because it will have full controls for a single-player game, and it is different from the 
enhancements because it is single-player.

First enhancement:
We hope to add a two-player mode in which the player who clears a certain number of lines first wins 
the game. The controls will either be on the same keyboard, such as WASD and arrow keys, or on two 
keyboards in which case we would most likely have to use someone else’s library. This enhancement is 
different from the prototype and main project because it will have two players racing instead of just 
one player playing infinitely.

Second enhancement: 
We hope to add another two-player mode in which the two players can send lines to each other, based on 
the multiplayer arena mode on tetrisfriends.com. For example, the first player clearing 4 lines at once
will add 4 lines, each with one gap, at the bottom of the second player’s screen. This enhancement is 
different from the first because it involves the players interacting directly with each other, not just racing.
